# BuuPass flight booking

Uses Fastify with TypeScript, database as MongoDB and ejs as the templating engine.

## How to run the app

1. Clone to local machine `git clone https://github.com/dannysofftie/buupass.git`

2. Change directory `cd buupass`

3. Install dependencies `npm i`

4. Run development version `npm run dev`

5. This step is optional, ensure you have typescript installed globally if development version fails in the first run (In step 3 above)

    - `sudo npm i -g typescript`
    - `npm run build`
    - `npm start`

6. If all above fails, or you might want to skip build and installation process, the application is hosted on [Heroku here](https://buu-pass.herokuapp.com/)
